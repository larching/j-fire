# Fire Danger Web Interface

## Introduction
The Fire Danger Web Interface is a prototype web application intended to display dangerous regions near 
an active wildfire. There are many factors that increase the intensity of a wildland fire; wind, incline 
of terrain, type of tree, dryness and thickness of foliage. With modern sattelite imagery many of these 
factors can be conveniently mapped and intuitively displayed. 

The hope of this project is to build an auxillary safety resource for wildland firefighting. It also may 
have its place in public safety too. 


## How to run
Open the `index.html` in the `static` directory in a Javascript capable web browser with internet access.

## Goals
During the inital development of this application the developers performed several user testing sessions. 
The planned features are reflective of the feedback that was gathered during these testing features.

### Current Features
* Dummy/example data
* Primative OpenLayers interface
* Geocoder
* Geolocator


### Planned Features
* Sattelite map layers
* More descriptive map point information
* Layer management/switching tool
* Offline mode
* Map legend
* Tools to draw on the map
